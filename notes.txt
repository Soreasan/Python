To run programs using the command line in ubuntu type either:
python programName.py
python3 programName.py
and then the program will run.

Alternatively if you have either of these at the top of the file:
#!/usr/bin/python3
#!/usr/bin/python
#!/usr/bin/python2
AND you've used chmod 777 programName.py
then you can run the program by using:
./programName.py 
from the command line.
